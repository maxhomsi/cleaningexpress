// //adicionar o API para achar o ZIP
// Hi Max Homsi,

// You recently created and activated a ZipCodeAPI account. 

// Here's how to use ZipCodeAPI with your API Key for free.

// Determine which API you want to use. Let's say you want to see the zip codes within 10 miles of a zip code and get the response in miles in JSON format. You'll use Zip Code Radius:

// Copy the API call into your app: https://www.zipcodeapi.com/rest/RUaDLEErVyZpl2i45yeZPoAxJw5A3TOg9zOyRRdx7JLfSXBRo11axyArwTdkSNPU/radius.json/<zip_code>/10/mile
// Replace the <zip_code> parameter with any zip code.

// That's it. You can make 10 API calls per hour, every hour, for free. If you want more than that, check out the plans https://www.zipcodeapi.com/Plans
